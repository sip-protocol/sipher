# SENTINEL Audit Log

Every SENTINEL decision and state change is logged to SQLite. Read via [`GET /api/sentinel/decisions`](./rest-api.md#get-apisentineldecisions) and [`GET /api/sentinel/blacklist`](./rest-api.md#get-apisentinelblacklist), or directly via `sqlite3` against `$DB_PATH`.

## Tables

Four tables hold the audit surface. All schemas below are copied verbatim from `packages/agent/src/db.ts`.

---

### sentinel_blacklist

Soft-deletable list of blocked addresses. Insert via [`POST /api/sentinel/blacklist`](./rest-api.md#post-apisentinelblacklist); soft-remove via [`DELETE /api/sentinel/blacklist/:id`](./rest-api.md#delete-apisentinelblacklistid). Removed rows are kept with `removed_at`/`removed_by`/`removed_reason` set — never physically deleted.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sentinel_blacklist (
  id              TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  address         TEXT NOT NULL,
  reason          TEXT NOT NULL,
  severity        TEXT NOT NULL,
  added_by        TEXT NOT NULL,
  added_at        TEXT NOT NULL,
  expires_at      TEXT,
  removed_at      TEXT,
  removed_by      TEXT,
  removed_reason  TEXT,
  source_event_id TEXT
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_blacklist_active
  ON sentinel_blacklist(address) WHERE removed_at IS NULL;
```

**Sample row** (a soft-removed test entry from the T2 capture):

```json
[{"id":"01KQP25BM8RVZJ92CTANFDNTMG","address":"BAD11111111111111111111111111111111111111","reason":"spec capture sample","severity":"low","added_by":"admin:C1phrE76Wrkmt1GP6Aa9RjCeLDKHZ7p4MPVRuPa8x85N","added_at":"2026-05-03T04:39:49.128Z","expires_at":null,"removed_at":"2026-05-03T04:39:49.146Z","removed_by":"admin:C1phrE76Wrkmt1GP6Aa9RjCeLDKHZ7p4MPVRuPa8x85N","removed_reason":"spec capture cleanup","source_event_id":null}]
```

**Index:** `idx_blacklist_active` is a partial index on `address` filtered to active (non-removed) rows. Keeps active-blacklist lookups O(log N) without scanning soft-removed history.

---

### sentinel_risk_history

Past risk assessments per address. Populated by SentinelCore after every `POST /assess` call and by autonomous scanner runs. Each row captures the assessed risk level, numeric score, reasons array (stored as JSON text), and a recommendation string.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sentinel_risk_history (
  id              TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  address         TEXT NOT NULL,
  context_action  TEXT,
  wallet          TEXT,
  risk            TEXT NOT NULL,
  score           INTEGER NOT NULL,
  reasons         TEXT NOT NULL,
  recommendation  TEXT NOT NULL,
  decision_id     TEXT,
  created_at      TEXT NOT NULL
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_risk_history
  ON sentinel_risk_history(address, created_at DESC);
```

**Sample row:** `[]` — empty in a fresh capture. Populated by `/assess` calls and autonomous scan runs.

**Index:** `idx_risk_history` on `(address, created_at DESC)` — supports efficient per-address history queries ordered by recency.

---

### sentinel_pending_actions

Circuit-breaker queue. Populated when an action is scheduled to fire after a cancellation window (see [`SENTINEL_CANCEL_WINDOW_MS`](./config.md#autonomy)). Cancel via [`POST /api/sentinel/pending/:id/cancel`](./rest-api.md#post-apisentinelpendingidcancel). The `status` column transitions through `pending` → `executed` or `cancelled`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sentinel_pending_actions (
  id             TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  action_type    TEXT NOT NULL,
  payload        TEXT NOT NULL,
  reasoning      TEXT NOT NULL,
  wallet         TEXT,
  scheduled_at   TEXT NOT NULL,
  execute_at     TEXT NOT NULL,
  status         TEXT NOT NULL,
  executed_at    TEXT,
  cancelled_at   TEXT,
  cancelled_by   TEXT,
  cancel_reason  TEXT,
  result         TEXT,
  decision_id    TEXT
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_pending_due
  ON sentinel_pending_actions(execute_at) WHERE status = 'pending';
```

**Sample row:** `[]` — empty in a fresh capture. Populated by `scheduleCancellableAction` when SENTINEL queues a deferred fund-moving action.

**Index:** `idx_pending_due` is a partial index on `execute_at` filtered to `status = 'pending'`. The action-runner polls this index to find overdue actions without scanning completed or cancelled rows.

---

### sentinel_decisions

The decision log. One row per LLM-mediated assessment. Read via [`GET /api/sentinel/decisions`](./rest-api.md#get-apisentineldecisions).

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sentinel_decisions (
  id                TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  invocation_source TEXT NOT NULL,
  trigger_event_id  TEXT,
  trigger_context   TEXT,
  model             TEXT NOT NULL,
  duration_ms       INTEGER NOT NULL,
  tool_calls        TEXT NOT NULL,
  reasoning         TEXT,
  verdict           TEXT NOT NULL,
  verdict_detail    TEXT,
  input_tokens      INTEGER,
  output_tokens     INTEGER,
  cost_usd          REAL,
  created_at        TEXT NOT NULL
);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_decisions_trigger
  ON sentinel_decisions(trigger_event_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_decisions_source
  ON sentinel_decisions(invocation_source, created_at DESC);
```

**Sample row** (from the T2 `/assess` capture):

```json
[{"id":"01KQP24PG0KZCJVWJDQM8H3JAY","invocation_source":"preflight","trigger_event_id":null,"trigger_context":"{\"action\":\"vault_refund\",\"wallet\":\"C1phrE76Wrkmt1GP6Aa9RjCeLDKHZ7p4MPVRuPa8x85N\",\"amount\":1.5}","model":"openrouter:anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.6","duration_ms":440,"tool_calls":"[]","reasoning":"","verdict":"block","verdict_detail":"{\"reason\":\"schema violation\"}","input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":0,"cost_usd":0.0,"created_at":"2026-05-03T04:39:27.489Z"}]
```

**Indexes:**
- `idx_decisions_trigger` — links a decision back to the originating event (e.g., a deposit txid), enabling correlation between a preflight block and the transaction that triggered it.
- `idx_decisions_source` — supports `GET /decisions?source=...` filtering ordered by recency; covers all invocation sources (`preflight`, `autonomous`, `manual`).

---

## Retention

No automatic cleanup — rows accumulate indefinitely. There are no `DELETE FROM sentinel_*`, prune jobs, or TTL sweeps in the codebase. Manual prune via SQL when needed:

```sql
-- Remove decisions older than 90 days
DELETE FROM sentinel_decisions WHERE created_at < datetime('now', '-90 days');

-- Remove soft-deleted blacklist entries older than 1 year
DELETE FROM sentinel_blacklist
  WHERE removed_at IS NOT NULL
    AND removed_at < datetime('now', '-1 year');

-- Remove completed/cancelled pending actions older than 30 days
DELETE FROM sentinel_pending_actions
  WHERE status IN ('executed', 'cancelled')
    AND scheduled_at < datetime('now', '-30 days');
```

## Reading the audit log

```bash
# Latest decisions across all sources
sqlite3 -header -column "$DB_PATH" \
  "SELECT id, invocation_source, verdict, model, cost_usd, created_at FROM sentinel_decisions ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20"

# Active blacklist entries
sqlite3 -header -column "$DB_PATH" \
  "SELECT address, reason, severity, added_at FROM sentinel_blacklist WHERE removed_at IS NULL"

# Recent risk assessments for a specific address
sqlite3 -header -column "$DB_PATH" \
  "SELECT created_at, risk, score, recommendation FROM sentinel_risk_history WHERE address = ? ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10"

# Pending actions awaiting execution
sqlite3 -header -column "$DB_PATH" \
  "SELECT id, action_type, wallet, execute_at FROM sentinel_pending_actions WHERE status = 'pending' ORDER BY execute_at ASC"
```

> [!NOTE]
> `DB_PATH` env var defines the SQLite file location. Defaults: `/app/data/sipher.db` in production, `:memory:` for tests. See `packages/agent/src/db.ts:244-245`.
